TODO

* Add ability to remove node's from scene tree (The picking ray is currently
  inserted multiple times and drawn on top of each other each click)

* Test if an object's sphere is selected using the picking ray (code started in
  node.lisp)

* Enable geometry culling (don't draw off-screen objects)

* Add recursive assets: Assets should be able to obtain data from parent assets
